# in arrays we can do stuff like adding, deleting, retrieving.
# the method for adding or otherwise known as shoveling or pushing in javascript 
# is done with this << symbol
# we also have unshift to add to the beginning
# and we have pop to delete from the end
# finally shift to remove from the beggining

# to retrive we just key in at the index, like array[2]

# the last element in the array is said to be stored with -1, like array[-1] will return the last
# item that array contains

# array.index("at argument") gives where that index is in the array. if it's not in the array it will
# give you nill

# we can update an array like so, array[2] = "whatever"

# so if we want to create an array of words without having to use all the "" marks, we could just use this simplyfied short cut with words literal like this %w[words here]
array.capitalize capitalize the first character in the array
