# expressions always return a value while statement do not return anything

# at its heart, programming is structuring which ecpresions get evalueated and in what order that happens to soleve problems. 

# 3 type of statements: sequence (the order that the code runs), selection (condition for sequence) and repetition (repeat something before moving on)

# the if statement is structured like this:

# if somthing is TRUE
#   do something here
# end 
# we end the if statement with the end key word

age = 23
 
drinking = (age > 21) ? "I'm drinking rum tonight because I'm #{age}." : "let me go study"

puts drinking

# the difference between puts, print and p

# puts print stuff to the screen and goes to a new line while print stays in the same line

# p in the other hand print raw to the screen and return a value
